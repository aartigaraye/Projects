# Introduction
Greek mythology has exerted a profound influence on Western literature, art, and culture,
shaping collective narratives and moral frameworks for millennia. In every society, we raise
children by telling them stories of heroes, adventure, magic, and divinity to teach them the
difference between good and bad. Stories of gods, heroes, and monsters have not remained static
they have evolved through centuries of retelling, reinterpretation, and adaptation to the modern
world. Using the result of this project we can hypothesize the major changes in cultural norms
throughout time. These stories shape the upbringing of the future generation which paints the
structure of society and the evolution in these stories is an indirect portrayal of how societies are
evolving. This project seeks to use the tools and techniques in the field of digital humanities to
trace the transformation of Greek myth across literature. We will start with ancient narratives and
focus on how they have been retold in various cultural, historical, and linguistics context. We
aim to analyze both early modern version such as Homer’s Odyssey to contemporary adaptions
such as Rick Riordan’s young adult fictional novels. The research will combine text analysis and
other computational methods such as topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and social network
analysis to uncover the patterns in language, themes, character relationships, and moral outlooks
across different time periods. Through this exploration the project aims to answer the following
big research questions:
• How have the themes and moral lessons of Greek myths shifted across historical periods?
• How have the portrayal of key figures like Perseus, Apollo, Zeus, Hades, Medusa,
Odysseus, Achilles, etc., changed over time?
• How does language use and sentiment in modern retelling compare to the ancient
sources?
• What are the most significant structural and relational changes in the narratives over
time?
• How do these transformations reflect the changing values and concerns of the societies
that retell them?
By combining computational tools such as Voyant Tools, MALLET, Infinite Craft, Google
Embedding Projector, Python, and R, this project will map the evolution of Greek myths and
illuminate how cultural, political, and social changes have reshaped the telling of these
foundational stories.

# Overview
Greek mythology forms one of the cornerstones of Western literary and philosophical traditions.
From the epic poetry of Homer and Hesiod to the dramatic tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides,
Greek myths have provided a rich corpus for exploring human nature, fate, and morality. Over
centuries these myths have been retold and reinterpreted by authors, playwriters, and artists, each
generation adding a unique layer of their interpretation over the original version building a multi-
dimensional manifold of Greek myth. While the stories, songs, plays, and television adaptations
of figures like Achilles, Odysseus, Perseus, Apollo, and Medusa remained recognizable, their
portrayals, moral undertones, and narrative structures have evolved in response to the changing
political, social, and philosophical landscape.
Statement Of Innovation
Despite the vast body of research on Greek mythology, relatively little work has systematically
traced the evolution of mythic narratives using computational tools. Traditional approaches to
mythological studies have focused primarily on close reading and literary analysis, often
confined to a specific author, period, or theme. However, the rise of digital humanities and
natural language processing (NLP) techniques presents an opportunity to study Greek myth as a
dynamic, evolving corpus.
This project stands out by blending traditional literary analysis of Greek myths with cutting-edge
digital humanities tools, offering a novel methodology for examining the transformations of
classical literature We expect the computational resources at our disposal will reveal hidden
trends and insights that would have been difficult to expose using traditional means. Moreover,
this project will produce interactive visualization and accessible tools that allow users and future
scholars to explore the evolution of these myths in an innovative way.
