## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1
- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):**  
  𝛽₁ = 0  
  The number of playlists a song is in (predictor variable) and the number of streams (response variable) have no linear relationship.

- **Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):**  
  𝛽₁ ≠ 0  
  The number of playlists a song is in (predictor variable) and the number of streams (response variable) have some linear relationship.

### Hypothesis 2
- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):**  
  𝛽₁ = 0, 𝛽₂ = 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ = 0  
  None of the variables listed have a statistical impact on the number of streams.

- **Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):**  
  𝛽₁ ≠ 0, 𝛽₂ ≠ 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ ≠ 0  
  At least one of the variables listed above has a statistical impact on the number of streams.

### Hypothesis 3
- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):**  
  𝛽₁ = 0, 𝛽₂ = 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ = 0  
  None of the months are statistically significant to impact the number of streams.

  

- **Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):**  
  𝛽₁ ≠ 0, 𝛽₂ ≠ 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ ≠ 0  
  At least one of the months is statistically significant to impact the number of streams.

# RCBD of Distance of Paper Airplanes

## Research Question
Does the position of a paper clip on a paper airplane (nose, middle, or rear) significantly affect its flight distance?

By addressing this question, we aim to shed light on how weight distribution influences flight efficiency in paper airplanes and explore potential implications for real-world aerodynamics.

- **Description:** This study employs a randomized complete block design (RCBD) to ensure reliability and minimize variability. Each paper airplane serves as a block, while the treatments involve attaching a paper clip to different parts of the plane (nose, middle, rear, or no paper clip as a control). This design allows us to isolate the effect of weight placement on flight distance. It involves building standard paper airplanes and then adding a paper clip to different parts of the plane to observe how the added weight affects its flight distance. The experimental setup involves consistent materials and methods to control for extraneous variables. All planes are made from identical paper, and flights are conducted indoors to eliminate wind effects. Throwing technique, launch angle, and measurement methods are standardized to ensure fairness. Flight distances are measured in inches from the launch point to the nose of the airplane, with negative distances avoided, even in cases of backward flight. Ultimately, this paper seeks to determine whether the mean flight distances differ significantly across the treatments. Insights gained from this experiment will not only enhance student learning but also provide a simplified model for understanding fundamental principles in aerospace engineering.

#  Climate Watch historical emissions data: greenhouse gas emissions by U.S.

- **Description:** outlines the methodology, findings, and implications of our research on historical emissions of different countries, offering actionable recommendations. I have also built an interactive app so that users can select countries and see the emissions plots and percentages of the World's emissions. Through this report, we aim to highlight the challenges and opportunities in controlling global warming, supporting informed decision-making.

#  Internet Movie Database (IMdB)

- **Description:** The Internet Movie Database (IMdB) is a leading source of film- and media-related statistics. In this mini-project, we will explore various aspects about films (e.g. runtimes, ratings, etc.) and compare and contrast across several different characteristics.

# Flights from SBA Airport

- **Description:**  I am going to present a report/analysis of flights in CA and help visualize it through the maps. The data for this project is spread across several files (which is fairly common in data science projects). This is a mini analytical overview of flights coming in and out of the Santa Barbara airport. All the data has been provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In this mini-project, we will explore some of the aviation data that the BTS provides. Specifically, we will examine only flights from 2023 that routed through California. The main part of this project will be visualizing this giant chunk of data using different types of graphs.
