Spotify Streams Analysis
Research Question
How can artists use this model to strategically structure their music and plan the release dates to maximize their streams?

Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1
Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):
𝛽₁ = 0
The number of playlists a song is in (predictor variable) and the number of streams (response variable) have no linear relationship.

Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):
𝛽₁ ≠ 0
The number of playlists a song is in (predictor variable) and the number of streams (response variable) have some linear relationship.

Hypothesis 2
Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):
𝛽₁ = 0, 𝛽₂ = 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ = 0
None of the variables listed have a statistical impact on the number of streams.

Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):
𝛽₁ ≠ 0, 𝛽₂ ≠ 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ ≠ 0
At least one of the variables listed above has a statistical impact on the number of streams.

Hypothesis 3
Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):
𝛽₁ = 0, 𝛽₂ = 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ = 0
None of the months are statistically significant to impact the number of streams.

Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):
𝛽₁ ≠ 0, 𝛽₂ ≠ 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ ≠ 0
At least one of the months is statistically significant to impact the number of streams.
