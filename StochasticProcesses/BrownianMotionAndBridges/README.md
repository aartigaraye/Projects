# Brownian motion and Bridges with KKL expansion

Description: The project is aimed to simulate 100 paths of brownian motion and bridges via the Kosambi–Karhunen–Loève theorem. In the theory of stochastic processes, the Karhunen–Loève 
theorem (named after Kari Karhunen and Michel Loève), also known as the Kosambi–Karhunen–Loève theorem states that a stochastic process can be represented as an infinite linear 
combination of orthogonal functions, analogous to a Fourier series representation of a function on a bounded interval. The transformation is also known as Hotelling transform and 
eigenvector transform, and is closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) technique widely used in image processing and in data analysis in many fields.

There exist many such expansions of a stochastic process: if the process is indexed over [a, b], any orthonormal basis of L2([a, b]) yields an expansion thereof in that form. The 
importance of the Karhunen–Loève theorem is that it yields the best such basis in the sense that it minimizes the total mean squared error.
